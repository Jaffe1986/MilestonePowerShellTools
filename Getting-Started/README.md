# Getting Started (MORE)

If you are new to PowerShell, the main README on this project is a lot to digest all at once. The topics in this folder are here for when you''re ready for answers to common questions and errors.

The first few topics are specifically about getting started with PowerShell and don''t necessarily apply to Milestone at all. After that, we''ll start exploring common tasks beginning with getting connected to your Milestone system, running common commands and reports, and then some more advanced tasks like adding and configuring hardware and exploring some of the lesser-used cmdlets.

If you have the time, read through the topics in this folder and explore the examples. The Samples folder at the root of this repository are another good place to look for raw examples of how to write functions and perform tasks against a Milestone system. This folder aims to offer a more gentle approach to your PowerShell/MilestonePSTools experience.
